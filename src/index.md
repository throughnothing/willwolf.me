# William Wolf

I’m a Managing Partner at [Arche Capital](https://arche.capital), and an engineer, entrepreneur, and angel investor based in New Orleans, Louisiana. I'm also a founding member of [Nieux Society](https://www.nieux.xyz/).

I was previously a partner at [Polychain](https://polychain.capital), founding member at Tilt (acquired by Airbnb), and early engineer at Mailtrust (acquired by Rackspace).

I studied Computer Engineering, Music, and Math at [Virginia Tech](https://vt.edu). I'm interested in philosophy, raising free-thinking children, health optimization, and using technology as a means to increase freedom, and thus prosperity, in the world.
