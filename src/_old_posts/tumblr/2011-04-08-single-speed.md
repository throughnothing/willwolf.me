I like Biking. I’m drawn to the simplicity and elegance of the bicycle. I’ve been biking to work pretty regularly (read: whenever its above 35 degrees), for a while now, and I love it.One way to make biking even simpler is to get rid of the gears. I’ve been looking for a decent bike to turn into a single speed for a while, and finally a deal came up on craigslist that I couldn’t pass up…and it was already a single speed.I rode it to work and back twice this week (12 miles each way), and I’m loving it. It is definitely a little more strenuous at times, but its so simple, and you never have to think about changing gears. When you’re on a single speed, the only thing you can do is pedal, and maybe that’s the way it should be.
