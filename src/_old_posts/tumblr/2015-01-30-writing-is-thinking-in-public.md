I heard someone the other day mention that their blog was just them “thinking in public”.  It struck me as a pretty novel way of looking at blogging.  I’m someone who’s always chewing through crazy, and often terrible ideas (just ask my wife, she usually cringes when I tell her I have an “idea”).  But I’ve realized that I don’t have a good record of my thoughts and their evolution over time.So, with that in mind, I will try to fill this space with the things that swim through my brain as I remember to write them down.  Some of the thoughts I post will be works in progress, un-vetted ideas, terrible discussions with myself, and occasionally some interesting insights may even shine through.If that doesn’t excite you, then I don’t know what will!
