<blockquote>
<p>The price of Bitcoin to Come is 1 XBT to 1 XBT. Deflationary cryptocurrency is an option, and it peacefully coexists with its inflationary counterpart. With Bitcoin, no central authority can inflate the supply and force the holders to fund a war. One bitcoin will be the same amount of the total supply of bitcoins today as it will be in 100 years. If not Bitcoin, then something else – perhaps whatever the AI robot overlords decide.Fiat currency is a spectacular tool for elites to steer the economy and fund war. Bitcoin allows you to withdraw from imperialism without moving across political borders.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Really well-written piece on the history of Fiat currency in the United States, and its continual use as a means to fund war and violence.</p>

  <p>And, I think it’s usually wrong. I was thinking about my previous post on productivity increases, and realizing a lot of people would probably argue that “this time is different.”</p>
<p>Essentially the argument would be that, because technology is moving so much faster now, and we’re automating things at a pace never before seen, that the “harm” done from these productivity increases will be more dramatic than ever before.</p>
<p>I tend to agree with the fact that we are moving faster now, we’re automating faster, and we’re increasing productivity faster, but I don’t agree that this is harmful. Nor do I agree that the outcome of these productivity improvements will be any different from the millions of improvements of the past 10,000 to 1 million years of human advancement. Of course every moment in time is different from any other historical example, but to think the outcomes will be drastically different seems naive.</p>
<p>To me, its actually exciting that productivity is increasing that quickly. Imagine what we’ll be doing when nobody has to drive cars anymore, or possibly even own them. When businesses can order something online and have it there by drone in less than 30 minutes (when they can’t print what they need on their 3-d printer). Conversely, imagine if you still had to pay a human being to be your alarm clock, or if a person had to hand-deliver your email communications.</p>
<p>This time likely won’t be different. People will find ways to adapt, and society won’t be worse off for the productivity gains, but will be in awe of how we used to do things before them.</p>

  <p>I came across this pretty interesting <a href="http://www.nytimes.com/video/business/100000003491301/in-colorado-marijuana-pot-industrys-banking-problem.html">documentary</a> on the cannabis industry from thy New York Times. I have thought about this problem before as a huge opportunity for bitcoin.  Businesses like these can’t get access to the banking system, even though they are legitimate businesses.  Thus, they are forced to deal in, and pay to secure, large quantities of cash.  The video even mentions that particular business paying over $400,000 in cash to the Federal Government in taxes!</p>
<p>Think of how much they must pay for security, storage, and security for their storage because of all the cash they are forced to deal with. This seems like a huge opportunity for cryptocurrencies like bitcoin.  Bitcoin can be secured virtually for free (or with a $119 trezor), and has no transport costs.  A business could even do business without keeping any private keys on premises, which means even on a break in, they lose no money.  The iPad/Tablet accepting payments would only need the hierarchical deterministic (HD) public key to be able to generate new addresses, but would not be able to spend from them. The HD private key could be kept on a <a href="https://trezor.io">trezor</a>, or on paper, off premises in a secure location.The costs for securing cash are probably high enough that these businesses could offer significant discounts to users willing to pay in bitcoin.  Thus, users would have an incentive to find ways to get bitcoin and a motivation to spend them.This seems like one of the many opportunities that bitcoin creates.</p>

  <p>Scott Adams recently had a great post about Science’s Biggest Fail, in which he makes the case that science has failed at everything to do with diet and fitness. The article is very entertaining, and he make lots of great points, but I think his core point should be directed more at science media and its hyperbolic and even disingenuous interpretations, than the actual science itself. Adams writes:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>We humans operate on pattern recognition. The pattern science serves up, thanks to its winged monkeys in the media, is something like this:</p>
<ul>
<li>Step One: We are totally sure the answer is X.</li>
<li>Step Two: Oops. X is wrong. But Y is totally right. Trust us this time.</li>
</ul>
<p>Science isn’t about being right every time, or even most of the time. It is about being more right over time and fixing what it got wrong. So how is a common citizen supposed to know when science is “done” and when it is halfway to done which is the same as being wrong?</p>
</blockquote>
<p>I think this captures the true heart of the matter.  Science, and our scientific method, are not broken, but reporting and science journalism certainly may be functioning, lets say, less than ideally. I think Adams loves science just as much as I do. He states:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Science is an amazing thing. But it has a credibility issue that it earned. Should we fix the credibility situation by brainwashing skeptical citizens to believe in science despite its spotty track record, or is society’s current level of skepticism healthier than it looks? Maybe science is what needs to improve, not the citizens.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>I think he nails it spot on, but the track record that is spotty is the shoddy journalistic and media interpretations of the research.  In my experience reading actual studies, scientists generally seem to be guarded in their conclusions. They will only try to make claims that the data actually supports, which is often very conservative. There are certainly exceptions to this, which can be particularly worrisome once you trace the source of funding of the studies, but in general I find the actual science to be rather conservative and humble.</p>
<p>Once Men’s health and Time get ahold of the study, however, everything is blown out of proportion.</p>
<p>That’s how we go from this in 1984:</p>

<p>To this in 2014:</p>

</figure>
<p>Well, it turns out that maybe science wasn’t “wrong”, and a number of scientists who look at the actual studies and data have understood this for a long time.  It’s a typical case of science journalism being too quick to jump to conclusions, and not (intentionally or not) understanding that correlation does not equal causation.</p>
<p>Gary Taubes portrays this beautifully in his incredibly well-researched tome, <a href="https://www.amazon.com/Good-Calories-Bad-Controversial-Science/dp/1400033462/ref=sr_1_1?ie=UTF8&amp;qid=1510252661&amp;sr=8-1&amp;keywords=good+calories%2C+bad+calories">Good Calories, Bad Calories</a>.  For those with a little less time, I’d recommend his lighter version, <a href="https://www.amazon.com/Why-We-Get-Fat-About/dp/0307474259/ref=pd_sim_14_1?_encoding=UTF8&amp;psc=1&amp;refRID=1SX7VNZTNRXKXP29BF3W">Why We Get Fat</a>.</p>
<p>Overall I think Adams raises some great points, and I respect his opinions a lot. One thing I think we can take away from this is that we shouldn’t trust the hyperbolic and over simplified bite-sized headlines of science journalism.  Science is always more complex than that.  For things we really care about, we have to dig into the studies and learn to interpret science for ourselves, rather than let the media pundits do that for us.This can certainly be a daunting task, and understanding science can be a small education in and of itself, but we do have ways of solving these problems.</p>
<p>Some people, like Mr. Taubes, and Dr. Eades, are trying to write about what the science tells us in a more rigorous way that is consumable for the masses.  I think we’re starting to see more and more bloggers and even journalists who seek to be rigorous, and relay information to others about what the science really says, and what claims it actually can’t make (yet).  This level-headed approach has some promise, and everyone should begin to seek out journalists, bloggers, and scientists who they come to trust over time for their analyses.  More and more today we can more easily get the actual studies online, or read interpretations from the actual doctors themselves on their blogs.  What a wonderful thing :)</p>

  </div>
  <p>I just got back from a really great and refreshing trip to Paris, Brussels, and Amsterdam a few weeks back, and I once again realized how valuable this time away can be. I’ve found that disconnecting from the day-to-day can really help my creativity, my productivity, and even my sleep.</p>
<h2 id="creativity">Creativity</h2>
<p>A while ago I noticed that on long flights (particularly ones without internet), I become particularly creative and pensive. For a long time, I’ve even had a “Flight Notes” notebook in Evernote just for recording the thoughts/ideas that inevitably sprout up during flights. When cut off from everything else, it seems our brains are free to roam where we normally don’t let them stray.</p>
<p>This got me wondering if this ‘flight effect’ could be reproduced elsewhere. Though I still have a lot of progress to make on this front, I tried to stay mostly disconnected during my trip. I found that it definitely helped me clear my head, and be able to think about things differently, particularly when work problems would invariably pop into my head.</p>
<p>I’m going to try occasional “disconnects”, even if just for a few hours, now and a gain, to give my brain a rest and let my mind wander, much like it does on flights. The wandering brain is an increasingly rare thing in todays world of media, internet, and advertising distractions. Someone is vying for our attention 24-hours a day. I think disconnecting can help help us get some of ourselves back.</p>
<h2 id="productivity">Productivity</h2>
<p>It’s so easy to get caught up in the treadmill of being productive and always being ‘busy’ and getting ‘stuff’ done. How could disconnecting possibly help us be more productive?</p>
<p>For me, returning from a disconnect is incredibly refreshing. My passion for work projects is re-invigorated, and I generally find myself waking earlier, and getting into the office earlier. This helps me be really productive before the chatter and distractions of the day roll around.</p>
<p>Clearing the mind seems to really help you focus on what’s important and get it done.</p>
<h2 id="sleep">Sleep</h2>
<p>Ah sleep. Everyone sort of knows they aren’t getting enough, but nobody is sure how to get enough sleep and still get all the stuff done that we want to. When disconnecting on vacation, I noticed that I wasn’t staying up late on my devices (iPhone, iPad, Kindle, computer). This trend stayed with me (for a little while…) when I returned.</p>
<p>I realized I didn’t need to stay up the extra hour to read a few “important” articles, or even catch up on email. It’s rather relaxing to get in bed and go to sleep. That sounds simple, but I feel like many of us today do something more along the lines of: get in bed, get out your phone (just to set the alarm clock), check twitter, Facebook, news feeds, then check email just to be sure you’re caught up in the morning. By the time you’re to the sleeping part, you’ve shot your eyes and body with lots of blue light, disrupting your circadian rhythms, and re-waking you up. Now you finally try to go to sleep, but find it more difficult, so out comes the device again.</p>
<p>Disconnecting can help us realize this cycle and try to break out of it. We don’t need to always be connected, and those last few articles of the day can wait. Get in bed and let your mind relax in the blue-light-free darkness that it so enjoys.</p>
<p>I’ve been doing this (more or less) since I got back, and I’ve been going to sleep earlier, waking up earlier, and all around just feeling like I’ve gotten a better night’s sleep. It really is pretty simple, but not at all easy.</p>
<h2 id="just-disconnect-sometimes">Just Disconnect Sometimes</h2>
<p>So it seems for me there’s a simple (but not easy) way to improve my creativity, productivity, and sleep in one fell swoop: disconnect.</p>
